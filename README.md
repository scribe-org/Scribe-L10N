## Application text localization files for Scribe apps

**Scribe-i18n** is the home of the localization files that are included in each Scribe application. Scribe uses [Weblate](https://weblate.org/en/) for localization! Head over to [weblate.org/projects/scribe/scribe-i18n](https://hosted.weblate.org/projects/scribe/scribe-i18n) to localize the applications. Changes in this directory will be merged into other Scribe applications via this repo being a [Git Subtree](https://docs.github.com/en/get-started/using-git/about-git-subtree-merges).

> [!NOTE]\
> The [contributing](#contributing) section has information for those interested.

Scribe apps are available on [iOS](https://github.com/scribe-org/Scribe-iOS), [Android](https://github.com/scribe-org/Scribe-Android) (planned) and [Desktop](https://github.com/scribe-org/Scribe-Desktop) (planned). For the data formatting processes see [Scribe-Data](https://github.com/scribe-org/Scribe-Data) and for our data download API see [Scribe-Server](https://github.com/scribe-org/Scribe-Data).

Check out Scribe's [architecture diagrams](https://github.com/scribe-org/Organization/blob/main/ARCHITECTURE.md) for an overview of the organization including our applications, services and processes. It depicts the projects that [Scribe](https://github.com/scribe-org) is developing as well as the relationships between them and the external systems with which they interact.

### Issues [`â‡§`](#contents)

The [issue tracker for Scribe-i18n](https://github.com/scribe-org/Scribe-i18n/issues) is the preferred channel to let the team know if there are problems with localizations or to ask to work on new ones. Those interested in helping can check the [`-next release-`](https://github.com/scribe-org/Scribe-i18n/labels/-next%20release-) and [`-priority-`](https://github.com/scribe-org/Scribe-i18n/labels/-priority-) labels in the [issues](https://github.com/scribe-org/Scribe-i18n/issues) for those that are most important, as well as those marked [`good first issue`](https://github.com/scribe-org/Scribe-i18n/issues?q=is%3Aissue+is%3Aopen+label%3A%22good+first+issue%22) that are tailored for first time contributors. Generally issues in this repository will be marked with the [`localization`](https://github.com/scribe-org/Scribe-i18n/issues?q=is%3Aopen+is%3Aissue+label%3Alocalization) label.

### Localizing via Weblate [`â‡§`](#contents)

<a href="https://hosted.weblate.org/projects/scribe/scribe-i18n"><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/scribe-org/Organization/main/resources/images/logos/WeblateLogo.png" height="100" alt="Visit Weblate project" align="right"></a>

[Weblate](https://weblate.org/en/) localization is as easy as making an account and jumping into the Scribe-i18n project!

1. First [register at Weblate](https://hosted.weblate.org/accounts/register/) (you can also authenticate with GitHub or other accounts)

   - We suggest that you do link your GitHub account so you get credit for the localization commits!

2. Navigate to the Scribe-i18n project at [weblate.org/projects/scribe/scribe-i18n](https://hosted.weblate.org/projects/scribe/scribe-i18n)

3. Click on a language you want to start translating

4. You can browse the available strings or start translating directly

   - When translating a word, be sure to check the glossary context if you're not sure what the string's use is

   - You can also make use of Automatic suggestions to see machine translations if you need help

5. Hit `Save and continue` when you're ready to move to the next

6. Maintainers will open up pull requests from [Weblate](https://weblate.org/en/) to this repo

7. Scribe-i18n directories that are [Git subtrees](https://docs.github.com/en/get-started/using-git/about-git-subtree-merges) in other Scribe application repos are then synched

### Adding source strings [`â‡§`](#contents)

The base language for all Scribe applications is US English. If you'd like to edit the [en-US.json](https://github.com/scribe-org/Scribe-i18n/blob/main/Scribe-i18n/en-US.json) file, please [fork](https://docs.github.com/en/get-started/quickstart/fork-a-repo) the repo, clone your fork, and configure the remotes:

> [!NOTE]
>
> <details><summary>Consider using SSH</summary>
>
> <p>
>
> Alternatively to using HTTPS as in the instructions below, consider SSH to interact with GitHub from the terminal. SSH allows you to connect without a user-pass authentication flow.
>
> To run git commands with SSH, remember then to substitute the HTTPS URL, `https://github.com/...`, with the SSH one, `git@github.com:...`.
>
> - e.g. Cloning now becomes `git clone git@github.com:<your-username>/Scribe-i18n.git`
>
> GitHub also has their documentation on how to [Generate a new SSH key](https://docs.github.com/en/authentication/connecting-to-github-with-ssh/generating-a-new-ssh-key-and-adding-it-to-the-ssh-agent) ðŸ”‘
>
> </p>
> </details>

```bash
# Clone your fork of the repo into the current directory.
git clone https://github.com/<your-username>/Scribe-i18n.git
# Navigate to the newly cloned directory.
cd Scribe-i18n
# Assign the original repo to a remote called "upstream".
git remote add upstream https://github.com/scribe-org/Scribe-i18n.git
```

- Now, if you run `git remote -v` you should see two remote repositories named:
  - `origin` (forked repository)
  - `upstream` (Scribe-i18n repository)

If all looks good, then you're ready to start adding localizable key-string pairs via pull requests!

### Pull Requests [`â‡§`](#contents)

Good pull requests are the foundation of our community making Scribe-i18n. They should remain focused in scope and avoid containing unrelated commits. Note that all contributions to this project will be made under [the specified license](https://github.com/scribe-org/Scribe-i18n/blob/main/LICENSE.txt).

When making a contribution, adhering to the [GitHub flow](https://guides.github.com/introduction/flow/index.html) process is the best way to get your work merged:

1. If you cloned a while ago, get the latest changes from upstream:

   ```bash
   git checkout <dev-branch>
   git pull upstream <dev-branch>
   ```

2. Create a new topic branch (off the main project development branch) to contain your feature, change, or fix:

   ```bash
   git checkout -b <topic-branch-name>
   ```

3. Commit your changes in logical chunks, and please try to adhere to [Conventional Commits](https://www.conventionalcommits.org/en/v1.0.0/).

> [!NOTE]
> The following are tools and methods to help you write good commit messages âœ¨
>
> - [commitlint](https://commitlint.io/) helps write [Conventional Commits](https://www.conventionalcommits.org/en/v1.0.0/)
> - Git's [interactive rebase](https://docs.github.com/en/github/getting-started-with-github/about-git-rebase) cleans up commits

4. Locally merge (or rebase) the upstream development branch into your topic branch:

   ```bash
   git pull --rebase upstream <dev-branch>
   ```

5. Push your topic branch up to your fork:

   ```bash
   git push origin <topic-branch-name>
   ```

6. [Open a Pull Request](https://help.github.com/articles/using-pull-requests/) with a clear title and description.

Thank you in advance for your contributions!
